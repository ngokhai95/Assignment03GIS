; Specify boundaries of coordinate space:
world	1090000W	1050000W	370000N	410000N
;
; Import a sizeable number of records:
import	CO_Ouray.txt
;
; Take a look at the indices, if you like:
;debug	quad
;debug	hash
;
; Perform a few some single-match searches by name/state:
what_is	United States Mountain	CO
; 
; Check the pool:
debug	pool
;
what_is	The Blowout	CO
what_is	Skyrocket Creek	CO
what_is	Kerr-Ouray Number Two Mine	CO
what_is	Telluride Peak	CO
; 
; Check the pool; there should be five records, matching
; the preceding searches, with Telluride Peak at the MRU
; position and US Mountain at the LRU position:
debug	pool
;
; Now, let's fill the pool:
what_is	Thistledown	CO
what_is	Difficulty Creek	CO
what_is	Wildhorse Peak	CO
what_is	Terrible Mine	CO
what_is	Devils Armchair	CO
what_is	Middle Fork Spring Creek	CO
what_is	Mount Emma	CO
what_is	Weehawken Creek	CO
what_is	Mother Cline Slide	CO
what_is	Otonowanda Dam	CO
;
; The pool should now be full and the records should be exactly in
; the order shown:
debug	pool
;
; Let's hit the second record in the pool, and see if it
; moves to the top:
what_is	Mother Cline Slide	CO
debug	pool
;
; Now let's hit a record in the middle of the pool, and see if it
; moves to the top:
what_is	Difficulty Creek	CO
debug	pool
;
; Now let's hit the record at the end of the pool, and see if it
; moves to the top:
what_is	United States Mountain	CO
debug	pool
; 
; Now trigger a replacement by searching for a feature that's not
; in the pool, and see if the pool is updated correctly, the old
; last record should be gone and the new record should be at the
; beginning:
what_is	Blaine Draw	CO
debug	pool
;
; Load two more new records:
what_is	Bridalveil Creek	CO
what_is	Pleasant Valley Canyon	CO
debug	pool
;
; And load a few more new records:
what_is	Corkscrew Gulch	CO
what_is	Galena Lion Gulch	CO
what_is	Starvation Creek	CO
what_is	Alkali Ditch Number 1	CO
debug	pool
;
; And, finally, shuffle things with a few hits:
what_is	Weehawken Creek	CO
what_is	Bridalveil Creek	CO
what_is	Weehawken Creek	CO
what_is	Corkscrew Gulch	CO
debug	pool
